Hello! I am a second year computer science major at UC San Diego, originally from the San Francisco
Bay Area. My interests include machine learning, robotics, math, and music.

This site contains (or will soon contain) information about my projects, accomplishments,
qualifications, thoughts, or anything else I think I should share with the world. Much of it is
(or will be) archival -- for my future use and reflection -- but some of it will hopefully be useful or
interesting to someone besides myself.

My current projects of interest are [using machine learning to generate NES-style music
](http://github.com/emlaufer/NES-MusGen), using machine learning to predict fantasy basketball
scores (not currently on github), building [a chess engine with Rust](http://github.com/moreheadm/xanadu),
helping the [FIRST robotics team](https://www.falconxrobotics.com) at College Park High School
I was instrumental in founding, not failing school, and creating [this](https://moreheadmax.me)
website.

This is my first attempt at a website. It is made using Jekyll and hosted with Github.
More about Jekyll at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can see the source for the website
[here](https://github.com/moreheadm/moreheadm.github.io).
